# PLAYWARE

### This is a landing page for an imaginary cloud gaming company called Playware.

## Technologies

The entire webpage is created from the ground up using 
- HTML5 as markup and 
- CSS for styling. 
- **SASS** (CSS Extension) was used and was compiled using **node-sass**    


```bash
  npm install node-sass
```

**This is not necessary as I have not provided the SASS files instead final CSS code after compiling SASS is provided.**

## Responsiveness
The Website is currently only optimized for Desktop use
(1920*1080).

**Support for multiple screen sizes will be provided soon**
